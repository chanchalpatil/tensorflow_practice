# To build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.
